# 7Ã—7 Skyscrapers

I was very impressed with this task. 
At first glance, it looks very simple, but it's not. 
The main problem is the execution time. 
If we use a brute-force approach to try all possible variants, it would take a very long time.
The current solution does this in fractions of a second, on average in **0.1 seconds**.

This task actually motivated me to create this repository.
